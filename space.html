        <p>
            Humans tend to not comprehend impossible things, thus we reign supreme over other creatures. In reality
            though, Humans are even smaller then a spec of dust
            in this infinitely expanding universe.
            <br><br>
            We will take a brief tour around our dear solar system that we live in.

            <p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our
                solar system. The Sun is about 150 million kilometers from Earth, and without its energy, life as we
                know it could
                not exist here on our home planet.</p>

            <p>The closest to the Sun, Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than
                Earths' Moon. It is the
                closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It
                has
                a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't
                have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple. </p>

                Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however - there
                are radical differences between the two worlds.t's the hottest planet in our solar system, with surphace
                temperatures reaching up to 475 degrees Celcius.</p>

            <p>Our home planet, Earth, is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that's
                inhabited
                by living things. While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth
                sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
                polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and
                islands.</p>

                also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was
                even more active in the past.It is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the
                only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>

            <p>Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists - all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found
                the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the
                Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system - more than twice as massive as all the
                other planets combined. Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia
                and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's iconic Great Red Spot is a giant
                storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

                basketball. It sits at a distance of about 2.9 billion kilometers away from the Sun. Uranus is an ice
                giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia - above a
                small rocky core. This gas giant has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and the outer
                rings are
                brightly colored</p>

                our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our
                solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery.
                It has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. Voyager 2 is
                the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. No spacecraft has orbited this distant planet to study it
                at length and up close. The blue giant has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
